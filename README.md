# Stone-Processor
This is a work in progress mod for washing stone into iron and copper.

For now, there's only one research, with one machine (using the Oil Refinery sprite) to process your excess stone into ores.

### Conversion goes as follows:
5 stone = 50% 0-2 Stone, 0-4 Iron, 0-4 Coppter

### TODO:
* ~~Next version, will randomize the output.~~ DONE!
* Proper sprites. Please let me know if you're an artist willing to help.
* More tiers, such as: Burner, T1, T2...
* Mod support: Tin, Lead, Quartz...

Open for more suggestions.

Thank you!

*PS. This is my first mod.*
